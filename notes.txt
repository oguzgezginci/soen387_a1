mostafa todo : 

-return and display an id when the student registers

-bugfix 1 : see bugfix1 images ; database only has courses 555 and 333 inserted (manually in sql). I try to insert course 99 and I get the msg "99 already exists!". 

-make "enroll_server.php" (I send you just the "selected_course_code" and "student_id" of the course from the "courses_index.php" view, you make an insert into ENROLLMENT) :

-maybe we should remove the column "days" from the table "course" ? we already have the table course_days for that purpose
